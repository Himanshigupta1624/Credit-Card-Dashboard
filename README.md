# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

## Overview

This Power BI project provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing credit card transactions and customer data from an SQL database. The dashboard offers real-time insights into key financial metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Analysis**: Utilizing transaction and customer data from an SQL database, the dashboard provides real-time analysis of credit card financial data.
  
- **Key Performance Metrics**: The dashboard tracks key performance metrics such as total transaction volume, revenue, average transaction value, customer acquisition rate, and customer retention rate.

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations allow users to explore data dynamically, drill down into details, and filter information based on various criteria.

- **Trend Analysis**: The dashboard includes trend analysis tools to identify patterns and fluctuations in transaction volumes, revenue, and customer behavior over time.

## Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**: Transaction and customer data are extracted from the SQL database using Power Query or SQL queries.

2. **Data Transformation**: Data is transformed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis. This may involve tasks such as data type conversion, handling missing values, and merging tables.

3. **Dashboard Development**: The cleaned data is then used to develop interactive dashboards in Power BI Desktop. Visualizations are created to present key financial metrics and trends effectively.

4. **Sharing Insights**: Once the dashboard is developed, insights and findings are shared with stakeholders to support decision-making processes. This may involve presenting findings in meetings, sharing reports via email, or publishing dashboards to the Power BI service for broader access.
